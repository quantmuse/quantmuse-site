This website serves to share posts about how to develop a quant career, interesting ideas in finance, investment, mathematics or programming. 

This is the first post of many. 

To answer an existential question of the website, how did I became a quant? 

By accident.

When I was in college, I did not even know that this career existed. All I knew was that I am somewhat mathematically inclined (having participated in math Olympiads in high school) although I ultimately did not pursue an advanced degree in this field. 

Instead, I studied Economics and became quite enthralled with behavioural finance. I remember learning about heuristics and biases and found these concepts to be relatable. 

On the other hand, my financial matehmatic courses were dull and while terms like Black-Scholes and Ito calculus sounded familiar, I would be stumped if I had to explain these to a five-year-old. On the other hand, I would not have much difficulty explaining loss aversion (we love winning more than losing). 

Why can't financial mathematics concepts be explained clearly as well? One of my favourite Youtube channels, *[3blue1brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)*, does an excellent job with this, and it is my aim that this website can do the same.

But I digress. 

I guess what I was trying to say is that, back in college, I did not know the quant job even existed, but I liked mathematics and finance/economics. 

You can imagine how daunting it is to graduate from college and trying to find a job with only these criteria. At the same time, everyone tells you to get a **CFA** too because why not, it would only boost your credentials. 

So, by accident, I stumbled into finance, and spent a few years at the fringes of the vaunted **front office**. 

At this stage, I have not even learned how to code yet, and I was already 30 years old by then (!). 

If you are still reading this, thank you for your patience. It is a virtue that will come in handy in your development, especially in this field. 

If you are anything like me, who haven't figured out what to do in your career early on, fret not. 

My theory is that it is never too late to find that right combination and once you find it, make sure you focus your resources on developing right skills to land the opportunity. 

So, after a few years dabbling in the industry, I had the opportunity to work alongside a quant team (a proper one, mind you, with PhDs and what-nots). 

What struck me most is that everyone knows how to code, and that brought me back to my childhood -- I used to be so impressed by the commands on MS-DOS that they almost seem like magic! 

Back in those days, my only resources were programming books in bookstores, which cost too much anyway so I cannot afford them. I would read these books in the bookstore and memorise commands to try out at home. That is how I learned my *dir/w*, *cd..* and so on. 

Well, with this latest realisation, I found my combination. I vowed to reignite this long-lost childhood passion of mine and get good at programming too! Like many others, I did not know how to start as there were simply too many resources available. 

After some struggle, however, I eventually set down some time daily (you have to put in the work!) and finished my very first track on DataCamp -- [Quantiative Analyst with R](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/quantitative-analyst-with-r) -- hooray! I am ready for my quant job now. 

Except, not quite. 

It took another three years from that point to finally being accepted into a junior quant analyst role, only to realise that there is still so much more to learn to progress in this field. 

I think this is why being a quant make for such an interesting career because it combines so many elements: math, finance, programming and you will never run out of things to get better at. 

Given the breadth of knowledge and the learning curve, this is also why I started this website: to force myself to master these quant concepts well enough to the point of being able to articulate them in my own words(Feynman technique). 

In the process, I hope this serves to provide useful resources for any quant hopefuls out there. You don't need a PhD to succeed in this field, but you have to be resourceful.

There should be a new post every week, so watch this space.
